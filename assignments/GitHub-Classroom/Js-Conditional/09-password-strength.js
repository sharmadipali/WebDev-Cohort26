 *   5. Contains at least one special character (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?)
 *
 * Strength levels based on how many criteria are met:
 *   - 0–1 criteria → "weak"
 *   - 2–3 criteria → "medium"
 *   - 4 criteria   → "strong"
 *   - All 5        → "very strong"
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - Empty string → "weak"
 *   - Non-string input → "weak"
 *
 * @param {string} password - The password to evaluate
 * @returns {string} "weak", "medium", "strong", or "very strong"
